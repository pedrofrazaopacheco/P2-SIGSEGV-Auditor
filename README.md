# Project 2 SIGSEGV discovery bugs
 
This is a python script for generating a **small and compact** test for your project2 executable.

## How to use
- Clone the repo or download the tester.py
- Put the tester.py in the same folder as your executable
- Change the first variable **EXECUTABLE_NAME** to your name (not the .c program, just the executable)
- Run python3 tester.py.
- If your program does not stop in a few moments, it's creating an optimized test. Please be patient.
- Check the optimized test file that made a small test that broke your program

### Final note
Only run once at a time, and statistically, a random test will be created that will crash your program
Based on the *Infinite monkey theorem*
